# Lookout
## Hack for PennApps XII - September 4-6 2015

The number one challenge of living in the modern world is information overload, and keeping track of everything is no trivial task. Context switching between what is currently on your screen and any sort of organizational app is distracting and time consuming (think about accidentally flying three desktops over!). Often the distraction of noting down future plans is more than that of the text or phone call that notified you of it.

Lookout is a lightweight app that combines Notes and Calendar for rapid access to the most pertinent information in a glance. It provides three scratchpads to drop idle thoughts and to-dos in a snap, titling each one of them like the Notes app by taking the first two words of the note. It also provides three quick views of your calendar: two days, two weeks, and two months, displaying only non recurring events to cull out some of the noise and bring focus to the out of the ordinary.

Following the Apple Watch design principle of an interaction time of 5 seconds or less, the scratchpads are a no fuss interface, and calendars are readonly. Actions that require more in depth interaction such as checking plans for the next summer or adding an event are delegated to the Calendar app, which can be accessed by Command + clicking anywhere. The rich text format of the scratchpads can be exported as RTF files for convenience. Scratchpads are also saved to an intermediary file, in case of accidentally quitting the application, unexpected system crashes. or other unexpected issues. Because it lives in the status bar, it is accessible from all desktops and full-screened applications, and therefore lightning fast to both pull up and tuck away. 

## Special Thanks
I would like to extend my thanks to the Apple engineers who critiqued the UI and usability of my app as I worked. It was important for me that my app was aesthetically pleasing and made sense to others as well, so that it would not be a tool that only I could take advantage of.
